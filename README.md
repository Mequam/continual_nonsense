# Continual Nonsense

This is a proof of concept equation for taking a continual derivatives of
any polynomial function. 

The code can be simplified to not use recursion, but for now this is up here
as a proof of concept for this particular continual mapping from one derivative 
to another, and as a curiosity if nothing else :)
